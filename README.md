# LostAndChained

It's Nightmare and Void but for Silksong.

Lost Lace is reworked into a duo battle with Grand Mother Silk.
Lace takes more damage.
Certain phase transitions require you to hit a specific target, so don't get stuck striking the same enemy for 20 minutes wondering why the fight is infinite.

I know of the bug where Lace sometimes has her contact damage disabled. I have tried, and failed. So long as it isn't active when it shouldn't be, let's call it inbuilt gambling.
